## 2026-07-30 — Session 1: Planning & repo setup

**Done**
- Architecture plan written and approved → `docs/plans/2026-07-30-setu-architecture-plan.md`
  - 10 screens, 4 activities, session/data model, component list, folder structure,
    state approach, 8-phase build order, risk analysis
- Answered: deliverables = APK + deck + live demo + walkthrough · multilingual (EN/TA/HI) ·
  any test device · demo child persona ≈ 24 months
- `CLAUDE.md` written — auto-loads project context each session
- `README.md` written — includes Communication Matrix attribution and disclaimers
- `.gitignore` written — **blocks all audio/video before any media exists**
- Git repo initialised, pushed to `Sanjay-AI-ML/SETU` (private)
- Tooling: GitHub CLI installed and authenticated as `Sanjay-AI-ML`

**No code written yet.** Deliberate — plan first.

**Next up: Phase 0 — Scaffold**
- Vite + React + React Router
- Folder skeleton per plan (`routes/`, `components/`, `core/`, `data/`, `i18n/`)
- Stub JSON data files
- Consent/disclaimer gate screen + Home screen
- **Also on Day 1: a throwaway Capacitor Android build** to smoke out camera/mic
  permission problems early

**Open questions**
- ⚠ **Hard deadline date and hour still unknown** — needed to set cut-order trigger points
- Which 3 languages exactly confirmed? (assuming English + Tamil + Hindi)

**Watch out for**
- `capacitor.config` must never ship `server.url` — kills the APK on any other device
- Bundle MediaPipe `.wasm`/`.task` and Noto fonts locally, never CDN
- Demo Mode is a primary feature (Phase 3.5), not a last-day safety net
